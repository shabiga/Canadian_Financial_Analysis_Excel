# Canadian_Financial_Analysis_Excel
This project analyzes Canadian and Ontario-level financial data from Statistics Canada (Table 11-10-0016-01) to explore assets, debts, and net worth across different age groups. The data is organized into four sheets for clarity:
**Canada_All_Ages** – Overview of all age groups across Canada
**Ontario_Under35** – Analysis of individuals under 35 in Ontario
**Ontario_35to65** – Analysis of individuals aged 35 to 65 in Ontario
**Ontario_Over65** – Analysis of individuals over 65 in Ontario
The project leverages Excel and Power Query to clean, transform, and visualize the data. Interactive dashboards summarize trends and provide insights into financial behavior by region and age group.
