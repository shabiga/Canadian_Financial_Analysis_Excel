# Canadian_Financial_Analysis_Excel

This project analyzes Canadian and Ontario-level financial data from Statistics Canada (Table 11-10-0016-01) to explore assets, debts, and net worth across different age groups.
The project leverages **Excel** and **Power Query** to clean, transform, and visualize the data.
